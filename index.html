            <div class="articleImage imageLeft"><img src="assets/images/portrait.jpg" alt="Emily horseback riding in Iceland by the sea" />

            <p>I was born and raised in California, attended <a href="http://drexel.edu" target="_blank">Drexel University</a> in Philadelphia, wandered around central Europe for a bit, then found myself here in Austin to get involved in the tech industry. I have found some success with Content Management, Front-End Development, and User Interface Implementation, but the required skillset for that area is changing so I'm here at UT's Coding Bootcamp to keep up-to-date. I dream of a permanent position with a company that believes in investing in its employees. A 401(k) and home ownership would be nice, too.</p>
            <p>I love exploring. I love travel, road trips, camping, seeing new places and people, following rivers, and the National Forest system. In addition to exploring places, I love exploring ideas and my own mind. Using the wonders of Youtube and Pinterest, I taught myself how to shape, form, and solder sterling silver last year. I can set stones in simple bezel settings now, and I have made several sets of stacking rings, some big chain, and a couple of pendants.</p>
            <p>I plan to never stop learning, and to never stop exploring.</p>
            <p>Contact me if you need a website, or are interested in purchasing a 1987 Dodge Campervan.</p>
